"My theory on an existing crisis is that you have to be very strategic about each case's unique elements. If a crisis involves a legal component, you need a communication strategy that complements the company's legal objective.

I'm also very, very used to doing a lot of exhaustive research and finding interesting information from different sources.",Magnus Larsson,Communication
"The pop-music video is one of the most powerful communication tools we have. Most people have access to a phone, and you can click a video and absorb it in three minutes.

"Communication is very important. And the arts do that, whether it's film or theater.",Anne Archer,Communication
"It still amazes me how many musicians aren't really interested in engaging with their audience at all.
