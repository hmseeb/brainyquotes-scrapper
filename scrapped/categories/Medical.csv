"Why doesn't Apple stop for a year and make medical devices?

Having a faster, thinner telephone is not one of the world's biggest problems.",Luke Perry,Medical

"I had parents who believed I could do anything - and I know how that made me feel.

I had to struggle with giving up the idea of becoming a doctor myself.",Reese Witherspoon,Medical
"What we need in medical schools is not to teach empathy, as much as to preserve it - the process of learning huge volumes of information about disease, of learning a specialized language, can ironically make one lose sight of the patient one came to serve; empathy can be replaced by cynicism.",Abraham Verghese,Medical

"They call Howard University the 'capstone of black education.' Howard was one of the historically black colleges where people want to go and send their children.
